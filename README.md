# BerkeleyMLMods

In this package, I will atempt to translate to all the Machine Learning algorithm in theory that I learned from UC Berkeley ML/AI during my 6 months online cohort into modular programing.

All algorithm will be attempt to be written in modular programming for cleaner code and usability.

After every implementation of the algorithms in code, I will provide leetcode like problem to work through a problem solving question by applying the algorithm.

I've create this repo:
https://github.com/dcnguyen060899/BerkeleyMLMods

because:
1. UC Berkeley program goes through the theory of ML and only use procedural programming (Using Functions) to implement algorithm.

2. I want to apply modular structure Object-Oriented Programming (Using Classes) on to algorithms for every Machine Learning concepts I learned and understood from the program.
  2.1 For learning purposes, I want to apply my data structure and algorithm skills.

After this program finished, you may git clone my BerkeleyMLMods packages to use the algorithm from the library on your dataset.

With the final capstone project, I will be use my own packages that I wrote for analysis and modelling.

**Follow me through each module each week.**
